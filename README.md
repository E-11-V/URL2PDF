Disclaimer: this script was written by ChatGPT. I have no knowledge of python.

URL2PDF converts a list of urls containing images into a pdf. It is useful to download books and manuscripts that are digitized and available in repositories that do now allow the download of the entire book/manuscript.

For this purpose, it is recommended that those interested make their own excel template to generate the urls, as each repository will use different urls and will require some degrees of fine tuning. 

Happy to provide assistance with this for the repositories of the Bib.Vatic., El Escorial, and Bologna's Colegio de Espa√±a.
